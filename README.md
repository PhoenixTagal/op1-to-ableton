# op1-to-ableton
op1-to-ableton is a light weight wav file converter which makes wav files bounced from the op1 field ready for use in Ableton!
#

**The problem:**

OP1 Field currently exports a 32-bit wav PCM file.

Ableton does not currently support 32-bit *integer* wav PCM files. Ableton does support 32-bit float Little Endian wav files.

A common workardound ableton reccomends is to bring the 32-bit wav PCM file into Audacity and convert it to a 32-bit *float* wav file. Which falls into the Ableton supported 32-bit float Little Endian. 

op1-to-ableton makes this conversion in a lightweight software rather than opening up a seperate DAW.
